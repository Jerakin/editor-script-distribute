# Distribute

## State
This extension is currently not very usable. Before I can make this truly useful I need access to a nodes pivot and parent. See [#1](https://github.com/Jerakin/editor-script-distribute/issues/4) and [#4](https://github.com/Jerakin/editor-script-distribute/issues/4) 

## Install
You can use the these editor scripts in your own project by adding this project as a [Defold library dependency](https://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/). Open your game.project file and in the dependencies field under project add:  
https://github.com/Jerakin/editor-script-distribute/archive/master.zip

## Editor Script
This extension adds a few distribution tools to be used in your gui scenes.
